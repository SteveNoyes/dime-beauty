### What I learned

Without having image assets. I went to main website, downloaded webp. Converted images to png and removed the background. The only part I was unable to recreate was the shadow effect from the image onto the background.

I loaded the starter image onto an html page and used a color picker to find the hex values. 

I was unable to use the shopify font cdn so I went with Roboto from Google Fonts.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
